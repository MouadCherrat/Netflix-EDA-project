# Netflix-EDA-project

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset. EDA helps understand the data, identify relationships between variables, and extract valuable insights.

## Objective

- Understand the data's shape and structure
- Analyze variable interactions
- Identify less useful variables
- Extract preliminary information
- Visualize data using libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly

## Libraries Used

- chardet
- seaborn
- pandas
- re
- matplotlib.pyplot
- plotly.graph_objects
- pandas_profiling

## Data Loading

Multiple datasets are used in this project:
- netflix.csv
- titles.csv
- dataprime.csv
- datagenre.csv
- dataregion.csv

## Data Preparation and Analysis

Steps involved in the EDA process:
- Renaming columns for clarity
- Dropping irrelevant columns
- Merging datasets to add information
- Handling missing values
- Analyzing top directors, shows, movies, genres, countries, cast, release years, and age ratings
- Generating a data report using pandas-profiling

## Results and Findings

The project provides insights and visualizations on various aspects of the dataset. It includes analysis of top directors, shows, movies, genres, countries, cast, release years, and age ratings. A data report is generated to summarize the dataset.

## Conclusion

EDA is an essential step in data analysis to gain initial insights and understand the dataset's characteristics. It helps make informed decisions and guides further analysis.
